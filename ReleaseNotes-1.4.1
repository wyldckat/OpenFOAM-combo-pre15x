OpenFOAM release notes for version 1.4.1
OpenCFD Ltd, 2 August 2007
http://www.opencfd.co.uk
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

OpenFOAM-1.4.1 is predominantly a patched version of the 1.4 release
including some important bug-fixes, many of which were reported on the
bugs-list on the discussion forum (http://www.openfoam.org/bugs.html),
but also includes some significant developments detailed below.

This release passes all our standard tests and the tutorials have been
broadly checked.  If there are any bugs, please report them using the
instructions set out in: http://www.openfoam.org/bugs.html

Linux version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The binary packs of the OpenFOAM release were compiled using SuSE
Linux version 10.2.  We recommend that users run OpenFOAM on this or an
equivalent version.  Running on one version lower has been generally
successful in testing, with one notable problem: the binary distribution
of the GCC 4.2.1 compiler was found to be incompatible with system 
utilities of SuSE Linux 9.3.  This can be overcome by compiling GCC
4.2.1 from sources.

C++ Compiler version
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- released compiled with GCC 4.2.1, the latest release.
- built in support for the Intel C++ 10.0 compiler.
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
  Note: The choice of compiler is controlled by the setting of the 
  $WM_COMPILER and $WM_COMPILER_ARCH environment variables in the 
  .OpenFOAM-1.4.1/bashrc (or cshrc) file
  !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Developments to solvers (applications)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New turbDyMFoam a transient solver for incompressible, turbulent flow of
  Newtonian fluids with moving mesh incorporating the PISO/SIMPLE/PIMPLE
  p-U solution algorithms.
- icoDynFoam transient solver for incompressible, laminar flow of Newtonian
  fluids with moving mesh now incorporates the PISO/SIMPLE/PIMPLE p-U solution
  algorithms.
 
Developments to utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
- New fluent3DMeshToFoam converter to convert 3D meshes from Fluent format to
  OpenFOAM format including full support for all BCs, zones etc.  The previous
  fluentMeshToFoam is still supported to convert 2D meshes and will convert
  3D meshes but there are many limitations which fluent3DMeshToFoam remedies.
- New foamFormatConvert: Converts all OpenFOAM mesh and field field files
  associated with a case into the format specified in the controlDict,
  e.g. converts binary files to ASCII and vice versa.

Model development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- Implementation of the k-omega  SST turbulence model for high-Re external and
  internal compressible flows (not fully tested).

Boundary conditions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The single largest change to the core of OpenFOAM in the 1.4.1 release is
  the introduction of fvsPatchField type for surfaceFields and the change of
  the internal-field reference type in all fv and fvsPatchFields from Field to
  DimensionedField giving the patch fields access to the name, dimensions etc.
  of the GeometricField of which the patch field is a part.  This reference can
  also be readily up-cast to the GeometricField from which the DimensionedField
  is derived giving complete access to the top-level field.

Mesh handling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The set of finite-volume mesh-motion solvers extended to include velocity
  (as before) and displacement which are advantageous for periodic motion 
  because the mesh regains it's original form at the end of each complete
  period.  Both velocity and displacement solvers are provided in
  componentLaplacian and Laplacian variants and in addition an experimental
  SBRStress displacement solver is included in which the normal solid stress
  equations are altered to support solid-body rotation.

Generalised geometric/algebraic multi-grid (GAMG) solver
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- The handling of asymmetric matrices has been improved and the correction
  scaling switched off by default for these matrices as this generally gives
  better convergence.  If the asymmetric matrices are near symmetric it may
  be beneficial to use scaling which can be switched on using the optional
  'scaleCorrection' switch.
- The set of smoothers available for asymmetric has been extended to include
  DILU and DILUGaussSeidel as well as the standard GaussSeidel which may give
  improved convergence rates for difficult asymmetric matrices.
- The GAMG solver now completely replaces the old AMG solver which is no longer
  supported.  The GAMG solver can operate in a similar manner to the old AMG
  solver by selecting the 'algebraicPair' agglomerator although the
  'faceAreaPair' has proved superior in all of our tests.
- The default solver for the coarsest matrix has been changed from direct to
  iterative and the direct solver can be selected using the optional
  'directSolveCoarsest' switch.

Discretisation schemes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- New filteredLinear2 scheme which is an improved form of the filteredLinear
  scheme release with 1.4.  The aim of these schemes is to remove
  high-frequency modes with "staggering" characteristics by comparing the
  face gradient with both neighbouring cell gradients and introduce small
  amounts of upwind in order to damp these modes.

Changes to defaults for parallel running
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- OpenMPI-1.2.3 replaces LAM-7.1.2 as the default MPI used by OpenFOAM.
  LAM and other MPI implementations are still supported and can optionally
  be built and linked with OpenFOAM.

Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- foamUser and foamUtil libraries replaced by the more general dlopen method
  in which any libraries may be included at run-time using the optional 'libs'
  entry in the case controlDict, e.g. to replicate previous automatic inclusion
  of the foamUser and foamUtil libraries include
  libs ("libfoamUser.so" "libfoamUtil.so");
  in controlDict.
- Improved wmakeScheduler used by wmake for parallel compilation either
  on multi-CPU/core machines or on clusters of machines.
- Corrected prefetch cache optimisations for all solvers for the
  Itanium2 processor.
