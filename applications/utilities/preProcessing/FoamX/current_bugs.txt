Bugs
----

2]
(startup)
The C++ codes read the ns.ref file as well as the Java.
They should contact nsd directly. 04/02/03: C++ codes use commandline arguments
passed through.

3]
(startup)
- also if roots are incorrect and cannot be read) you get no warning.
8/1/02: partially fixed: is warning message from FoamXCaseBrowser
--> FOAM Warning : User specified root directory '"/aaaa/run/LES"' not found.
Removing from root directories list.

5]
(job handling)
When running from foamX: after run has finished process icoFoam or
blockMesh is still there (ps -u mattijs):
     6504 ?        00:00:02 icoFoam <defunct>
Only closing case (pressing Close button) makes process go away.
Means that spawning process has not waited for it.
FIXED. 20/03/02. Put waitpid in ProcessControl::kill.

26]
(startup)
If licenseserver gets killed and restarted foamX gets confused.
Unclear message. Should it be possible to reconnect (by rereading ns.ref?).

116]
(tools)
Mesh changing tools do not reread mesh/fields.
Maybe 'tool' like blockMeshTool?
FIXED(partially). 03/02/03. CasePanel monitors dictionaries belonging to case.
Small bug: 'Save Dictionary' doesn't suppress file monitoring.

117]
(case opening)
if mesh&fields are not consistent (changing number of patches)
you get exception:
FoamXError:
Type mismatch, expected scalar, got invalidType
in function FoamX::FoamXAny::SetValue(const FoamXServer::FoamXAny&)
in file FoamXAny.C at line 87
CANNOT REPRODUCE. 04/02/03. Adding patch to 'boundaryField' is no problem
(not used). Deleting patch info from 'boundaryField' just makes it use default
values.

119]
(case panel)
create new case and then import mesh does not work.
Does work if you save & close new case.
Henry: Import mesh is file-only business. Rest of case is in memory.
You want merge but only can be done on file level. Hence save and reopen.
FIXED. 03/02/03. Create Case now does save immediately.

121]
(file/directory selection)
Extend tree to allow browsing inside case to import files.
FIXED (Partially) 11/02/03. Removed import case.

122]
(caseBrowser)
clone case does not allow cloning from different root/case.
And also does no selection of e.g. time steps to copy (now copies
all which might be a problem e.g. if transMeshed).
Chris' idea for cloning:
 - LatestTime
 - Zerotime
 - NoTime
 - Alltimes
FIXED. 11/02/03

123]
(case browser)
import case does not allow importing from different root/case
FIXED. 11/02/03. Removed import case.

125]
(selection editor)
read-only entries in a selection are greyed out.
Is confusing since they can still be selected.
FIXED. 07/02/02

126]
(create case)
After 'create case' and close case popup says: 'save' or 'close'. Closing
at this point creates illegal case. (since system/ directory not written).
Better: ask 'save' or 'delete'.
FIXED. 30/01/03. Now caseServer does initial save when called with '-create'.

142]
(create case)
Application class is straight pull down instead of now hierarchical.

128]
(case browser)
?? Test import case. Chris cannot get it to work.
Also what is it more than create a new case or open existing case.
Only controlDict is converted?
Import is mainly for importing old version cases. Only will work if case
did work previously. Does not fix anything,
just changes controlDict to include new application class.
(clone case is just directory copy).
FIXED. 30/01/03. Removed import case.

129]
(dictionary editor)
Timeformat is Optional but
- if they don't have it, it is scientific
- if they do have it, it is general.

130]
(java1.4)
CaseBrowser & caseServer cannot be closed. Some communication seems to
be done even after caseServer has been shut down. E.g. when closing caseBrowser
from caseBrowserPanel:
FIXED. 21/03/02 "oneway" attribute in Idl.

140]
(tools)
Tools should check whether case has been modified (i.e. disk state not
consistent with files) before running. Can be stupid, i.e. just check any.
FIXED. 06/03/02

141]
(import mesh)
If import is meshDescription only FoamX pops up box: "no mesh defined"
Yes? What is the problem?

143]
(process editor)
process window not resizable
FIXED. 25/03/02

144]
(process editor)
Select multiple and do remove/end/cont etc.
Doing last entry gives out-of-bounds in getValueAt
FIXED.

145]
(process editor)
Is modal.
FIXED.

146]
(run panel)
Running cases cannot be done in same way as running utilities
(the run panel does not get used)
FIXED. 06/03/02

147]
(run panel)
Sort out argument handling (args are not passed to invokeUtility)
and display as text in JLabel
FIXED. 06/03/02


148]
ICaseBrowser.invokeUtility throws:
"Error executing utility magUtrolDict" (should be ".. magU")
FIXED. 19/03/02

150]
Utilities cannot be split into subdirectories any further. Gives null
pointer when building tools menu.
FIXED.

153]
Open casebrowser. Open/edit case. Close case.
Close casebrowser. Now open casebrowser on other machine and try to edit
case -> coredump.
FIXED. 15/03/02

154]
no possibility of hand editing arguments. E.g. parallel running?

155]
parallel running tool

156]
Logs/Probes:
- text tail log (should wait until log appears. Sleep is done on Java side)
- text view log
- graph tail var in log
- graph view var in log
- graph tail probe
- graph view probe

157]
(run panel)
If log file does not exist FileEditor tries to use the caseBrowser.readFile.
Does not handle correctly if file does not exist.
FIXED. 19/03/02

158]
(startup)
If nsd is slow to start up (but has already written ns.ref), FoamX.App can
not start up. ("Default name service could not be contacted.")
FIXED in runFoamX

159]
(process editor)
End/EndNow a job in the Process Editor and it stays in the runningJobs.
Even 'status' will not recognize it has moved.
Only 'read' will reread the directories.
FIXED. 26/03/02

160]
(mesmdec2)
Selection editor sized too small.
Run Panel sized too small.
Process Editor Panel sized too small.
FIXED? 10/02/03

161)
(sgi, process editor)
RunningJobs panel in process editor has white bar behind end/endNow/etc. buttons
FIXED. due to vncserver insufficient color depth.

162]
(process editor)
On slow machine Corba can timeout (e.g. running foamProcessInfo on turner)
leaving it in bad state.
Ok if timeOut set to larger value.

163]
(selection editor panel)
Title should be title of entry
FIXED. 21/03/02

164]
(run panel)
Run a case (e.g. icoFoam) in foreground. Kill icoFoam process. 
Upsets Corba and FoamX does not work anymore.
CANNOT REPRODUCE. 4/02/03. It pops up panel saying 'icoFoam exited with
return code 15'

165]
(process editor)
Should show number of float licenced jobs
FIXED. 21/03/02

166]
(process editor)
If in runningJobs/ there is jobInfo file of non-licensed machine you
get a FoamXError "unexpected error" from caseBrowser.checkRunningJobs.
FIXED. 21/03/02. Exception not mentioned in Idl file.

167]
(patch editor)
title says 'fixedValue' instead of patchname.
NOT A BUG. is name of dictionary.

168]
(process editor)
'Compact' button does not do anything
FIXED. 26/03/02

169]
(process editor)
'kill' 'susp' 'cont' gives 'Error continuing process'
FIXED. 21/03/02. waitpid problem?

170]
(process editor)
FoamEndJob does not work on parallel job.
FIXED. 22/03/02

171]
(process editor)
FoamEndJob does not work on relative root.  (e.g. icoFoam .. cavity)
FIXED. 24/03/02

172]
(App)
Do something with command line arguments.
FIXED. 04/03/02.  runFoamX <host> <root> <case>. Open case does not work yet.

173]
(process editor)
If job has no root/case in jobInfo file,  foamEndJob should not be called.
FIXED. 26/09/02

174]
(dictionary editor)
Cannot edit dieselFoam dictionary. Complains about selection() out of bounds.
FIXED. 31/12/02. Changed 'selection' to 'multivariateSelection'.

175]
(case browser)
if already exists a case directory but without controlDict then creating a
case with this name and then trying to save upsets Java.
FIXED. 04/03/02. CreateCase now does initial save which overwrites it!

176]
(runpanel)
Chris: want no just "root" and "case" recognized and filled with default
but also "sourceRoot" (for mapping tool)
FIXED. 11/03/02. Just use caseAndRoot type.

177]
(case editor)
'Read Mesh' also rereads fields but only internal values, not boundary values.
Correct and split into 'Read Mesh' and 'Read Fields'
FIXED. 05/03/02. Difficult to split though since change of patches also changes
boundaryField (only things constant are 'internalField' and 'type' for patch)

178]
(run panel)
Chris: utilities that update mesh and/or fields should have flag and after
running throw up panel saying 'Reread mesh?' 'Reread fields?'
Or even better: automatic detection. Get timestamps on files in mesh and
files in current set time directory.
FIXED. 04/02/03

179]
(reference level)
Henry: reference level has been removed. Rework into C++ and Java. Update from
Henry's stuff.
FIXED. 01/02/03. Hacked from caseEditorModule.


180]
Cannot resolve URL from /FoamX/icons/small/maths/interpolationScheme.gif
Cannot resolve URL from /FoamX/icons/small/maths/snGradScheme.gif

181]
DictionaryEntryEditor (e.g. one used for 'patch value' editing has title of
boundaryType ('fixedValue') instead of patchName ('movingWall')
FIXED. 04/02/03. Now: 'U/movingWall'

182]
Chris:When something has been changed in the FoamX buffer you are
usually prompted  to save if you try to close the case.  However, if
the thing that is changed is a patch type, you do not get prompted to
save.
FIXED. 04/02/03. (added modified() to patchProperties.H)

182]
in caseChooserDlg you are allowed to 'Open Case Browser'.
Is not supported internally.

183]
No possibility of rereading dictionaries. But is supported for mesh & fields.

184]
caseBrowser tree does not get refreshed sometimes if case gets closed.

185]
If clone case fails the case list gets messed up. Unlock-case should remove
any case from caseList in caseBrowser.

186]
Chris: for his tutorials: no boundary file. When opening case and then saving
it overwrites fields with ones without all the carefully set boundary info.

187]
Start with arguments to open case automatically:
runFoamX penfold $FOAM_RUN/icoFoam cavityTut
Now in caseBrower busyCursor is still on.
10/04/03. REMOVED busy cursor from openCase

188]
View Log file. - Followmode does not work.

189]
(simpleEditor)
Does not have key shortcuts.

190]
(runPanel)
No default set for root and case. 'arguments' field in dictionary
FIXED. 10/04/03.

191]
(runPanel)
E.g. for fromRoot, fromCase also defaults.
FIXED. 10/04/03.


192]
(cloneCase)
Have it detect if nothing has been edited and do nothing.
FIXED. 10/04/03. Now has confirmation dialog.


**** APPEARANCE ***************************************************************

130]
Close button does not close all dictionary windows.
Open e.g. field (say U), open boundary condition window.
This (managed) window does not close.

131]
(button bar) 
The four save and close case icons at the left of the icon bar should
all be removed since: save current case and close current case
duplicate the save/close case buttons on the right of the button bar;
save all cases does nothing; close all cases is not particularly
useful.  
FIXED.

104] 
(button bar)
Remove FoamX_Options button - it does not do anything useful.
FIXED.

132] 
(changes to button icons) 
Open/Close_Case_Broswer (they are the same as start/stop FOAM run)
perhaps a terminal for Open_Case_Browser 
Close_case (looks like stop run)

14] 
(case setup)
Tools are not accessible from the menu bar at the top of the screen.

108]
(case panel)
Icons for fields dont work (icons for dictionary entries do!)
(Chris)

109]
(case panel)
BlockmeshTool does not use SimpleEditor
FIXED.

110] (dictionary editor) 
Description of an individual entry in a dictionary in bottom panel of
toplevel dictionaryEditor appears only in dictionaryEditor, not in any of the
other editors.

127]
(case editor)
Nice to know which time is set in database so when you are editing fields
you know which one is being edited.

133] 
(menu bar)
When editing a case there should be File -> Save Case (and other options)

118] 
(font)
Font in FoamX is not very nice.
(Dx one is much better)

********************************************************************************

**** APP CLASS EDITOR (not for version 2.1) ************************************

11]
(application class editor)
The order of a set of entries cannot be changed in the editor, ie no
swap-up/   swap-down capability.  This is a real problem if you make a
mistake in the ordering of something like a dimensionedScalar

13]
(application class editor)
When you edit `constrained values' the app class editor window gets
moved to the bottom of the pile of windows - you get the feeling you
have lost it.

16]
(application class editor)
There is no save button in the window - users have to know that they
are able to save on close

17]
(application class editor)
In fact, even if you have just saved, it always asks if you want to
save. Not sure?
