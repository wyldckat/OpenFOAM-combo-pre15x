Example of use:

- set controlDict::startFrom to latestTime

- run simulation

- decomposePar

- do your bit on the processor meshes; make sure not to
  affect any point (or rather edge) on the processorPatches.

  e.g. in setSet

    # Collect all patches to protect
    faceSet f0 new patchToFace procBoundary0to1
    faceSet f0 add patchToFace procBoundary0to3

    # Pick up all cells not using point on them
    pointSet p0 new faceToPoint f0 all
    cellSet c0 new pointToCell p0 any
    cellSet c0 invert

  refineMesh .. cavity -dict

- reconstructParMesh
